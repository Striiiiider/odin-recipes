    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple recipe for delicious buttery cookies</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb unsalted butter</li>
            <li>9 3/4 oz brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 1/2 oz granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, cold</li>
            <li>11 1/2 oz all purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 Tbsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>3 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3 oz butterscotch chips</li>
            <li>2 1/2 oz toffee almond chocolate, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 oz pretzels </li>
            <li>1 oz peanut butter breakfast cereal</li>
            <li>1 oz caramel popcorn</li>
            <li>As needed finishing salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a medium skillet until melted. Continue cooking the butter until the milk solids separate and sink to the bottom of the skillet, about 3-4 minutes. Continue cooking until the milk solids are golden brown and toasted, an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the browned butter into a heat-proof vessel and refrigerate until firm. </li>
            <li>Transfer the refrigerated browned butter to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugars and mix, using a paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure the mixture is homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Start adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing thoroughly in between additions. Make sure to scrape down the bowl in between additions as well, this will ensure the entire mixture is well combined. </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda. Whisk to evenly distribute the ingredients. </li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients all at once to the mixing bowl, then mix at low speed until the batter is just combined. </li>
            <li>Add in the additional toppings and mix until just combined, any excess mixing will result in unwanted gluten development. </li>
            <li>Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough into mounds. Place them on a large, rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Wrap the sheet tray in plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for 3 days.</li>
            <li>Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, bake the cookies at 325Â°F for 20-30 minutes. Halfway through the baking time, rotate the pan and top with finishing salt.</li>
            <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the sheet pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Enjoy warm or at room temperature. </li>
        </ol>
