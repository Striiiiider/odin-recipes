    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Candy takes a turn for the deadly this week as we recreate the viral honeycomb candy from Squid Game, whose complex shape must be extracted to avoid a bullet to the head. The stakes are decidedly lower in real life, but as it turns out, dalgona has a few tricks up its sleeve...or I'm just very bad at making it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the sugar to a medium metal ladle. </li>
            <li>Over medium-low heat, begin melting the sugar. Constantly stir the sugar with a chopstick or heat-proof spatula. If the sugar begins to smoke or burn, remove it from the heat for 5-10 seconds while stirring, then return it to the heat.</li>
            <li>Once all the sugar has melted and turned an amber color, remove the ladle from the heat. Add the baking soda and stir thoroughly to incorporate. Return the ladle to the heat for 2-5 seconds at a time to keep the sugar mixture hot. </li>
            <li>Pour the homogenous sugar mixture onto a non-stick heat-proof surface. Allow the mixture to cool for 30-45 seconds or until the surface temperature reaches 275Â°F.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture has cooled a bit and is no longer sticky, compress the sugar with a circular metal press. </li>
            <li>Quickly remove the press from the surface of the candy and gently press the design cutter of choice into the center of the wafer. Make sure not to cut all the way through the sugar.</li>
            <li>Allow the dalgona to cool on the non-stick surface for 2-3 minutes before using a metal spatula to detach the wafer.</li>
            <li>Allow the candy to cool fully before consuming.</li>
        </ol>
